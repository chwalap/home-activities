# Home Activity Tracker & Rewards System

## Overview

The Home Activity Tracker & Rewards System is a Python-based application that tracks and rewards domestic activities. It uses a Raspberry Pi 4 as the server to capture NFC tags scanned via smartphones. This system is designed for multi-user environments, specifically focusing on households. The system includes features such as daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards and to-do lists.

## Key Features

- **Multi-User Support**: Supports multiple users (Pawe≈Ç and Jacqueline, in this case).
- **NFC Enabled**: Use NFC stickers around the house to report activities like brushing teeth, doing laundry, etc.
- **Activity Points**: Assigns point values to each activity.
- **Leaderboards**: Daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards.
- **To-Do Lists**: Automatically generated to-do lists based on daily and weekly required activities.
- **Session Persistence**: Uses SQLite to manage sessions, making it robust against server restarts.
